This Repo shows my work on the analysis of the University of Sussex e-resources data. The analysis explores the usage and the seasonalities in the usage behaviour.
Moreover, two ML approaches (SARIMAX and FB Prophet) were used and compared to try and forecast the future usage which can then be used in planning and ROI analyses.
